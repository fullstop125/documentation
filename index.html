            Technical documentation is any document that explains the features of the respective product. In this project, we are going to create a technical documentation of C++ using HTML and CSS. The webpage has a menu sections that helps to 
            navigate to different sections of the webpage.

                    Object-oriented programming â€“ As the name
                    suggests uses objects in programming.
                    Object-oriented programming aims to
                    implement real-world entities like
                    inheritance, hiding, polymorphism,
                    etc in programming. The main
                    aim of OOP is to bind together the data
                    and the functions that operate on them
                    so that no other part of the code can
                    access this data except that function.

                <header>C++ Object oriented programming</header>
                <p>The building block of C++ that
                    leads to Object-Oriented programming is a Class.
                    It is a user-defined data type, which holds its
                    own data members and member functions, which can
                    be accessed & used by creating an instance
                    of that class. A class is like a blueprint for
                    an object. For Example: Consider the Class
                    of Cars. There may be many cars with different
                    names and brand but all of them will share
                    some common properties like all of them will
                    have 4 wheels, Speed Limit, Mileage range etc.
                    So here, Car is the class and wheels,
                    speed limits, mileage are their properties.</p>

                    <header>Hello world</header>
                    <article>
          To get started with writing C++, open the Scratchpad and write
          your first "Hello world" C++ code:
          <code
            #include <iostream>
              int main() {
    std::cout << "Hello World!";
    return 0;
}
          </code>

        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Variables">
        <header>Variables</header>
         <p>
          Variables are containers for storing data values.

In C++, there are different types of variables (defined with different keywords),

        </p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Declaring_variables">
        <header>Declaring variables</header>
        <p>To create a variable, specify the type and assign it a value:</p>
        <code>type variableName = value;</code>
        <p>Where type is one of C++ types (such as int), and variableName is the name of the variable (such as x or myName). 
          The equal sign is used to assign values to the variable.</p>
          </section>
          <section class="main-section" id="Variable_scope">
           <header>Variable scope</header>
           <p>The scope of a variable is the area of the program where the variable is valid. A global variable is valid from the point it is declared to the end of the program. A local variable's scope is limited to the block where it is declared and 
             cannot be accessed (set or read) outside that block.</p>
             </section>
             <section class="main-section" id="Global_variables">
            <header>Global variables</header>
           <p>When you declare a variable outside of any function, it is called a
            global variable, because it is available to any other code in the
            current document. When you declare a variable within a function, it
            is called a local variable, because it is available only within that
            function.</p>
            </section>
            <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
             <header>Constants</header>
             <p>Constant identifiers have the same syntax as variable identifiers: they must begin with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign,
                and they can contain alphabetic, numeric, or underscore characters.</p>
                <code>const PI = 3.14;</code>
                <p>While the script is executing, a constant's value cannot be changed by assignment or
                   re-declared. It must be given a value to begin with.</p>
                   <p>
            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block
            scope variables. If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is
            assumed to represent a variable.
          </p>
          <p>
            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or
            variable in the same scope.
          </p>
          <section class="main-section" id="Data_types">
              <header>Data types</header>
              <p>There are  seven data types:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>Six data types that are primitives:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                <li>
                  null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because
                  JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null,
                  NULL, or any other variant.
                </li>
                <li>
                  undefined. A top-level property whose value is undefined.
                </li>
                <li>Number. 42 or 3.14159.</li>
                <li>String. "Howdy"</li>
                <li>
                  Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances
                  are unique and immutable.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

            <li>and Object</li>
          </ul>
          Although these data types are a relatively small amount, they enable
          you to perform useful functions with your applications. Objects and
          functions are the other fundamental elements in the language. You can
          think of objects as named containers for values, and functions as
          procedures that your application can perform.

        <header>if...else statement</header>
        <p>Use the if statement to specify a block of C++ code to be executed if a condition is true</p>\
        <code>if (condition) {
  // block of code to be executed if the condition is true
}</code>
<p>Note that if is in lowercase letters. Uppercase letters (If or IF) will generate an error.</p>
<p>In the example below, we test two values to find out if 20 is greater than 18. If the condition is true, print some text:</p>
<code>if (20 > 18) {
  cout << "20 is greater than 18";
}</code>
</section>
<section class="main-section" id="while_statement">
        <header>while statement</header>
        <article>
          A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified
          condition evaluates to true. A while statement looks as follows:
          <code>while (condition) statement</code> If the condition becomes
          false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to
          the statement following the loop.
          <code>while (condition) {
    // body of the loop
}</code>

        <header>Function declarations</header>
        <article>
          A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function
          statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:

          <ul>
            <li>The name of the function.</li>
            <li>
              A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and
              separated by commas.
            </li>
            <li>
              The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in
              curly brackets, { }.
